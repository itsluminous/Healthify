NOTE 1 : If due to no internet connectivity in phone or any other reason the weather was not updated successfully, then instead of temperature only the text "pebble" is shown. So don't freak out !
NOTE 2 : This watchface has been tested on emulator for pebble classic, pebble 2 and pebble time 2 so please mail me in case you find any issues.
